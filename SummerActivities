Chris Bucker:
This summer I had spent most of my time relaxing and learning some new skills outside of coding. Due to the ongoing pandemic I lost any opportunity to get an internship
so I decided to learn some kitchen skills. I learned how to make various types of foods from scratch, such as pizza. I also began learning how to bake, my favourite
being oatmeal cookies from scratch. It was a lot of fun to get my mind off the chaos going on in the world and learn a new skill.

Daniel Gonzalez:
I spent a lot of time relaxing this summer because of the onging pandemic. I spent some time taking some online courses to catch up with credits. Most of my time was
spent playing videogames and hanging out with some friends online. I did take a little bit of time to do some cooking and learn new recipes. I have also been playing D&D
with my friends online and am currently DMing a game for them. It has been a lot of fun and a lot of work to come up with all the homebrew material I am using.
